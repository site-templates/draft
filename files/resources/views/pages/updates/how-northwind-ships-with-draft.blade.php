    <p class="lead">Northwind builds logistics software for mid-market freight — 140 people, four product lines, and a release cadence that used to be monthly on a good month. A year after moving to Draft, they ship every Tuesday and Thursday. We asked Priya Shah, their head of platform, what actually changed.</p>

    <h2>The before picture</h2>

    <p>Northwind's old setup will sound familiar: a heavyweight tracker for engineering, a spreadsheet for the roadmap, a docs page for release notes that was updated "quarterly, in theory." Each surface was fine. The seams between them were not.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Our status meeting existed to reconcile the tracker with reality. Forty-five minutes, twelve people, every Monday — we were paying an engineer-day a week to sync data by voice.</p>
        <cite>Priya Shah, Head of Platform, Northwind</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Cycles that tell the truth</h2>

    <p>The first change was structural. Northwind mapped each product line to a team and put every team on two-week cycles. Draft rolls unfinished work forward automatically and charts scope changes as they happen, which had an effect Priya didn't expect: estimates got honest.</p>

    <p>"When carryover is visible and automatic, nobody pads the cycle to look good. The burndown says what happened either way. We plan about 20% less per cycle than we used to claim — and finish it."</p>

    <h2>Two releases a week</h2>

    <p>Shipping twice a week wasn't a goal; it fell out of the tooling. Merged work accumulates against the open release, an agent drafts the notes, and publishing to the public changelog is one review away. When announcing costs minutes instead of an afternoon, batching stops making sense.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Release notes go from merged PRs to published changelog in under ten minutes.</li>
        <li>Support reads the changelog before the release lands — tickets about "mystery changes" fell to near zero.</li>
        <li>Customers subscribe to the digest; the biggest ones read it in Slack.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The meeting they deleted</h2>

    <p>The Monday status meeting is gone. Its replacement is a saved view — live, honest, and available Tuesday through Sunday too. "We didn't replace the meeting with a better meeting," Priya says. "We replaced it with the absence of a question. The data is just true now."</p>

    <h2>Advice for the next team</h2>

    <p>Priya's counsel for teams considering the same move is short: run one real cycle in Draft next to your old stack, with one team that ships often. "Don't migrate beliefs. Migrate one team, measure one cycle, and let the tab count on everyone else's browser make the argument for you."</p>
